#### Prediction Chicago car crashes factors

##### Abstract

Car accidents is an important and directly related topic in people's daily lives, According to statistics from the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), there were 92,092 car accidents in the city of Chicago in 2020. Of these, 133 accidents resulted in fatalities and 19,755 caused injuries and 12,526 involved visible injuries that did not incapacitate the victim.
Machine learning can be a useful tool for analyzing and reducing the risk of crashes. in this project, an analysis of Chicago traffic accident data of year 2020 is demonstraed, followed by prediction of accident primary causes based on random forest model.

#### Data Collection

Chicago car crashes can be obtained at [Traffic Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)

The links and descriptions of datasets are listed below:

[Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if)

[Traffic Crashes - Vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Vehicles/68nd-jvt3)

[Traffic Crashes - People](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-People/u6pd-qa9d)



#### Goal

Create a model to predict and classify prime contributory factors of car crashes related to year 2020.



#### Metrics

- accuracy_score

- roc_auc_score

  

#### Models - Classifiers

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging Classifier



#### Liberary / API

- Pytthon version 3.85
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn



#### Conclusion

Random Forest Model predicts car crashes with 78% accuracy even dealing with imbalanced dataset with 102 features. The accuracy of the model can be improved by including the data of previous year (2015-2020).  Increasing the prediction accuracy as a potential use case, the the developed model can be used as a car accidents dediction system to predict the car crash occurances in real time.
